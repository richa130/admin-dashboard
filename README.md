# Richa Bav's Dashboard :D
This project solidified many intermediate CSS concepts such as CSS Grid, custom properties, advanced selectors, pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes, and positioning.

This is not an functional dashboard! It is just a mockup of an admin dashboard, which I made solely to practice my CSS skills.

The layout was created with a combination of CSS grid and flexbox. I also made a dark and light mode, which can be accessed by clicking the sun/moon icon on the top right.
